# Introduction

Supervised multinomial classification is an essential aspect of Machine
Learning. Sectors such as Business analysts, Data scientists, Financial
analysts, and medicine are required to predict the data category based
on feature instance vectors. The simple multinomial regression model is
the most fundamental statistical method to serve the purpose; however,
several advanced classification models such as RandomForest, and Neural
Network have evolved over the years, which have brought a revolution in
prediction accuracy. RandomForest has a very versatile application based
on a decision tree hierarchy. On the other side, Neural network
performance has improved over a few decades as more and more data are
available for training. Performance comparison is a crucial aspect of
choosing the best Statistical model for data. Overall classification
accuracy and group-specific classification accuracy are the two most
prominent used performance measures for supervised multinomial
classification.

The research project aims to evaluate the best multinomial
classification models based on some performance measure criteria.
Specifically, the main objectives are to design a study to access
performance in classification, measure the performance of a simple
multinomial regression model, and compare the performance to that of
other statistical methods.

The study goes through exploratory and formal data analysis of 4
datasets; Abalone, Car evaluation, Nursery school application, and
Contraceptive method choice. All of the datasets have multi-class
categorical output and a set of covariates. The aim of the analysis is
specific for each dataset; predicting the age of abalone from physical
measurements for Abalone dataset, indicating the car acceptability for
given features of cars for Car dataset, predicting the contraceptive
method choice of women based on several characteristics about women for
Contraceptive method choice dataset, Predicting success or failure of
nursery class application provided socio-demographic information of the
parents for Nursery dataset. The datasets have been sampled at different
locations and sectors through a randomized method. The abalone dataset
has been sampled from the Abalone population in Tasmania. I. Blacklip
and Abalone found in North Coast and Islands of Bass Strait; the car
evaluation dataset has been obtained from a simple hierarchical decision
model previously developed for the demonstration of DEX; the
contraceptive method choice dataset has been collected from a part of
the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey; the nursery
dataset has been obtained from the applications of nursery schools in
Ljubljana, Slovenia. This report focuses on box plots, summaries,
scatterplots, histograms, bar plots, and proportional tables to develop
initial impressions about the data. While the study deepens on designing
a performance measure, fitting multinomial regression, Random forest,
and Neural network to each dataset, and comparing the outcomes.
Eventually, the conclusion section details the remark extracted from the
overall analysis.
