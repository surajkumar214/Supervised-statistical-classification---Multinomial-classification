 Supervised-statistical-classification---Multinomial-classification
 
 Datasets and descriptions:-
 
For the Abalone dataset the aim is to predict the age of abalone
from physical measurements; for the Car Evaluation dataset the aim is to predict the car
acceptability given its features; for the Contraceptive Method Choice the aim is to predict
the current contraceptive method choice (no use, long-term methods, or short-term methods)
of a woman based on her demographic and socio-economic characteristics; for the Nursery
dataset the aim is to predict whether applications to nursery school were successfull given
socio-demographic information of the parents. All these datasets have a multinomial class
variable and a set of features.

The main questions of interest are:
• The classification capability of the simple multinomial regression model.
• compare the performance of simple multinomial regression with other advance Statistical models.
• Designed a method to assess performance in classification.
 
 Analysis goes through several parts:-
